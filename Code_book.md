#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
##Overview

The project produces a tidy data set illustrating the mean of human activity recognition measurements from a Samsung smart phone. The raw data taken as input includes mean and std deviation for numerous phone gyroscopic and accelerometer measurements. These measurements are grouped by activity type and test subject and then averaged.

#Feature Selection

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Feature Estimates

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
Feature Estimate Averages by Group

Finally the mean() and std() estimates where averaged for each available combination of activity and subject id.

activity: the activity label for the current measurement
subject_id: the subject of the current measurement
remaining fields: the mean of the specified raw measurement for the current activity and subject id
